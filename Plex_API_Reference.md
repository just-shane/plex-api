# Grace Engineering: Plex Connect REST API Reference

## 1. Overview
This reference document synthesizes the discoveries from preliminary API testing and aligns them with the **Fusion 360 Tool Library Synchronization** architectural goals. It serves as the master guide for developers interacting with the Grace Engineering Plex instance (`plexonline.com`).

*Note: Grace Engineering runs Plex Classic, MES+ enabled, supporting Prime Archery and Montana Rifle Company.*

## 2. Authentication & Headers
All Plex APIs are routed through the developer portal. There is no session token or OAuth flow; a static subscription key is passed via request headers.

- **Developer Portal**: `https://developers.plex.com/`
- **Rate Limit**: 200 API calls per minute across all endpoints.
- **Base URL**: `https://connect.plex.com` (Production) / `https://test.connect.plex.com` (Test)

**Required Header:**
```http
X-Plex-Connect-Api-Key: <your_consumer_key>
```
> [!WARNING]
> The API key **must** be in the Request Headers. Placing it as a URL parameter will result in a 401 Unauthorized error.

## 3. Discovered Endpoints & Subscription Status
The target architecture requires pushing Fusion 360 data to the Tooling/Workcenter endpoints. Initial discovery revealed that certain API collections require activation by IT.

### ✅ Working Endpoints
| Collection | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Master Data | `mdm/v1/parts` | Returns master part records. Confirmed working. |
| Master Data | `mdm/v1/suppliers` | Returns supplier UUIDs (e.g., MSC Industrial). |
| Purchasing | `purchasing/v1/purchase-orders` | Returns full PO headers (e.g., tooling orders from MSC). |

### ⚠️ Blocked Endpoints (Action Required)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ACTION REQUIRED**: IT (Courtney) must enable the **Manufacturing**, **Inventory**, and **Tooling** API collections for the currently active App in the Plex Developer Portal. The following endpoints returned 403/404 during testing because the subscription is inactive:

- `tooling/v1/tools`
- `tooling/v1/tool-assemblies`
- `tooling/v1/tool-inventory`
- `manufacturing/v1/work-centers`

## 4. Current Tooling Data Flow (Fusion 360 to Plex)
While waiting for the Tooling APIs to be activated, data can be managed in two ways:

1. **REST API Automation (Target State)**
   - A scheduled script parses the network share `BROTHER SPEEDIO ALUMINUM.json` library.
   - Extracts `product-id`, `vendor`, and geometry.
   - Pushes payloads to `tooling/v1/tool-assemblies` to update the master inventory list.
   - Pushes payload to `manufacturing/v1/work-centers` utilizing the `post-process.number` to ensure correct turret/pocket placement.

2. **CSV Upload System (Interim State)**
   - Without API access, engineering relies on bulk CSV uploads.
   - Sequence: **Tool Assembly Upload** ➔ **Tool Inventory Upload** ➔ **Tool BOM Upload** ➔ **Routing Upload**.
   - Ensure the *Tool Assembly Type* picklist exists in Plex before attempting uploads.

## 5. Machine Integration (DNC Overview)
Outside of the Plex database, NC programs and tool alignments require pushing to physical machines on the floor:
- **Brother Speedio (879/880)**: Native FTP integration (`192.168.25.79`, `192.168.25.80`). Scripts can push programs directly via standard FTP.
- **Citizen / Tsugami**: Connected via Moxa NPort 5150/5250 converting RS-232 to TCP/IP.
- **Haas VMCs**: Native Ethernet on Sigma 5 boards.

*Plex DCS acts as the source-of-truth for NC programs natively; DNC protocols transfer them to machines just-in-time.*

## 6. Known Issues & Development Gotchas
- **Supplier UUIDs**: The `supplierId` in API responses is a UUID, NOT the supplier code (i.e. MSC is not `MSC001`). You must query the MDM endpoint to resolve vendor names to their internal UUIDs.
- **PO Filters**: Filtering by `type` strings containing spaces (`MRO SUPPLIES`) requires proper URL encoding (`%20`). Undetected encoding issues will result in zero-record responses rather than explicit HTTP errors.
- **PowerShell Curl**: Do not use the alias `curl` in PowerShell scripts. Use `Invoke-RestMethod` to guarantee proper header passage and JSON native ingestion.
