# Project Roadmap: Fusion 360 to Plex Sync

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Autodesk Fusion 360 tool library to Plex Manufacturing Cloud synchronization project.

## Phase 1: API Discovery & Authentication

- [x] Set up Postman and discover relevant Plex API endpoints.
- [x] Obtain API authentication credentials (Client ID/Secret or API Key) for the Plex environment.
- [x] Successfully authenticate via a test script (`plex_api.py`).
- [ ] **ACTION ITEM**: Regenerate API Key in the Developer Portal (Previous key was exposed in `.docx` git history).

## Phase 2: Local Data Reading & Parsing

- [ ] Identify the permanent network share path for the Fusion 360 tool library JSON files.
- [ ] Write a script to consistently read the JSON files from the network share (Fusion files are the absolute Source of Truth).
- [x] Parse the Fusion 360 JSON schema to identify key tooling attributes (Completed in `Fusion360_Tool_Library_Reference.md`).

## Phase 3: Plex API Source-of-Truth Implementation

- [ ] Implement API call to retrieve current tooling inventory from Plex (master list) to prep for overwrite.
- [ ] Implement API call to update/create purchased parts (focused first on **consumables** like cutting tools) in Plex.
- [ ] Implement API call to create/update Tool Assemblies, assigning the purchased consumable parts to them.
- [ ] Implement API call to link Tool Assemblies to Routings/Operations.
- [ ] Implement API call to update tooling within the specific Workcenter Document (`production/v1/control/workcenters`).
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Waiting on IT (Courtney) to enable Tooling & Manufacturing APIs in the Developer Portal.

## Phase 4: Data Mapping & Sync Logic

- [x] Create a mapping definition between Fusion 360 data structures and Plex API payload requirements (Completed in `Fusion360_Tool_Library_Reference.md`).
- [ ] Implement the core synchronization logic:
  - Utilize the Fusion JSON file output as the explicit Source of Truth relative to Plex.
  - Push updates for purchased consumables to the master inventory list.
  - Link those consumables into Tool Assemblies.
  - Ensure those assemblies dynamically flow down to the Routing and then the Job when run in the shop, linking tools directly to manufactured parts.
  - Push final setups to the workcenter documents.
- [ ] Add basic error handling and logging (e.g., logging successful syncs or failed API calls to a text file on the network share).

## Phase 5: Automation & Deployment

- [ ] Finalize the synchronization script.
- [ ] Deploy the script to a server or always-on PC with access to the network share.
- [ ] Schedule the script to run daily at midnight (e.g., using Windows Task Scheduler).
